## Your Tasks

1. **Analyze Parsed Data**: Review the extracted RFQ information

4. **Prioritize**: Rank missing information by importance for quoting

## Output Requirements

Return your findings as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "missingFields": ["list of missing required fields"],
  "clarificationRequests": [
    {
      "field": "field name",
      "question": "Clear question to ask the customer",
      "context": "Why this information is needed",
      "priority": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW"
    }
  ],
  "canProceedWithQuote": true|false,
  "blockerReason": "If cannot proceed, explain why"
}
```

- Be specific in your questions - avoid vague requests
- Provide context for why information is needed
- Group related questions together
- Consider if we can make reasonable assumptions for low-priority items
